# C1_08_614_618_620_Energy_Consumption_Prediction
This project is a smart energy prediction system that estimates household electricity usage and monthly bill based on real historical power consumption data. The system uses a trained Machine Learning model (Random Forest, XG Boost, LSTM) to predict instantaneous power usage and an ARIMA time-series model to forecast future monthly consumption.
